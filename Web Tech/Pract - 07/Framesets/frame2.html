      During the Indian independence movement, Kanaiyalal Maneklal Munshi
      advocated for Akhand Hindustan, a proposition that Mahatma Gandhi agreed
      with, believing that as Britain wanted to retain their empire by pursuing
      a policy of divide and rule, Hindu–Muslim unity could not be achieved as
      long as the British were there."[7] In addition, Mazhar Ali Khan wrote
      that "the Khan brothers [were] determined to fight for Akhand Hindustan,
      and challenged the League to fight the issue out before the electorate of
      the Province."[8] On 7–8 October 1944, in Delhi, Radha Kumud Mukherjee
      presided over the Akhand Hindustan Leaders' Conference.[9] The Indian
      activist and Hindu Mahasabha leader Vinayak Damodar Savarkar at the Hindu
      Mahasabha's 19th Annual Session in Ahmedabad in 1937 propounded the notion
      of an Akhand Bharat that "must remain one and indivisible" "from Kashmir
      to Rameswaram, from Sindh to Assam." He said that "all citizens who owe
      undivided loyalty and allegiance to the Indian nation and to the Indian
      state shall be treated with perfect equality and shall share duties and
      obligations equally in common, irrespective of caste, creed or religion,
      and the representation also shall either be on the basis of one man one
      vote or in proportion to the population in case of separate electorates
      and public services shall go by merit alone."

      The call for creation of the Akhand Bharat or Akhand Hindustan has on
      occasions been raised by Hindu nationalist organisations such as the Hindu
      Mahasabha, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, Vishva Hindu Parishad, Shiv Sena,
      Maharashtra Navnirman Sena, Hindu Sena, Hindu Janajagruti Samiti,
      Bharatiya Janata Party etc.[11][12][13][14] One organization sharing this
      goal, the Akhand Hindustan Morcha, bears the term in its name.[15]
      Pre-1947 maps of India, showing the modern states of Pakistan and
      Bangladesh as part of British India illustrate the borders of a
      proto-Akhand Bharat.[13] The creation of an Akhand Bharat is also
      ideologically linked with the concept of Hindutva (Hindu nationalism) and
      the ideas of sangathan (unity) and shuddhi (purification).[14] The first
      chapter of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh textbook for standard VII
      students at Akhil Bharatiya Sanskrit Gyan Pariksha included a map
      depicting Pakistan and Bangladesh, which along with post-partition India,
      were territories that were part of "Akhand Bharat" and a trade union
      magazine of the same organization also included Nepal, Bhutan, and
      Myanmar.[16] While the leadership of the right-wing BJP wavers on the
      issue, the RSS has always been a strong proponent of the idea.[17][18] RSS
      leader H. V. Seshadri's book The Tragic Story of Partition stresses the
      importance of the concept of Akhand Bharat.[19] The RSS affiliated
      magazine Organiser often publishes editorials by leaders such as the
      present Sarsanghachalak, Mohan Bhagwat, espousing the philosophy that only
      Akhand Bharat and sampoorna samaj (united society) can bring "real"
      freedom to the people of India.[20] The call for Indian reunification has
      been supported by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi,[21] and BJP
      National General Secretary Ram Madhav.[22] Akhand Bharat calendar released
      by RSS campaigners on 17 Nov, 2020 in Jaipur In December 2015, following
      Narendra Modi's diplomatic visit to Lahore, Pakistan, the BJP National
      Secretary Ram Madhav (in an interview with Al Jazeera's Mehdi Hassan)
      described that "The RSS still believes that one day [India, Pakistan and
      Bangladesh], which have for historical reasons separated only 60 years
      ago, will again, through popular goodwill, come together and Akhand Bharat
      will be created."[23] In March 2019, RSS leader Indresh Kumar claimed that
      Pakistan would reunite with India by 2025, that Indians would settle in
      and migrate to Lahore and Lake Mansarovar in Tibet, that an Indian-allied
      government had been ensured in Dhaka, and that a European Union-style
      Akhand Bharat would form.[24] Former Indian Supreme Court Judge Markandey
      Katju advocated in Pakistani newspaper The Nation that the only solution
      to the ongoing dispute between India and Pakistan is the reunification of
      India, Pakistan and Bangladesh under a strong, secular, modern-minded
      government.[25][26] He expanded on the reasons for his support for a
      reunified India in an article for Newslaundry;[27] Katju advocated that
      such a state would be administered by a secular government.[28] Katju
      serves as the chairman of the Indian Reunification Association (IRA),
      which seeks to campaign for this cause.[29][30] The former Indian Deputy
      Prime Minister Lal Krishna Advani, in April 2004, similarly endorsed a
      confederation of the sovereign nations of India and Pakistan as a powerful
      geopolitical entity rivaling the European Union, United States of America,
      Russian Federation and People's Republic of China.[31] Hindu nationalist
      political groups such as Shiv Sena, have sought the reclamation of
      Pakistan-administered Kashmir under the pretence of Akhand Bharat,
      especially after the abrogation of Article 370 and 35A of the Indian
      constitution (removing the semi-autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir) in August
      2019.[32][33] On 17 November 2020, the RSS campaigners released a calendar
      based on the "Akhand Bharat" theme. This calendar was prepared by the
      province patron of the Vishva Hindu Parishad in Jaipur.[34] In 2023, the
      unveiling of a mural in India's new parliament building, said to depict a
      map of the Maurya Empire under Ashoka, sparked controversy and criticism
      from several of India's neighboring countries. Spokesperson for the
      Pakistani Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mumtaz Zahra Baloch, criticized it
      as a "manifestation of a revisionist and expansionist mindset", while the
      Bangladeshi junior minister for foreign affairs stated "Anger is being
      expressed from various quarters over the map."[35] Several Nepali
      politicians also expressed concern. While the spokesperson of the Indian
      Ministry of External Affairs, Arindam Bagchi, stated it symbolized "the
      idea of responsible and people-oriented governance that [Ashoka] adopted
      and propagated", other politicians in the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party
      declared it a symbol of Akhand Bharat, with Minister of Parliamentary
      Affairs Pralhad Joshi tweeting "The resolve is clear. Akhand Bharat".[35]
