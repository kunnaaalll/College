      Lotus Temple, Bahāī Faith house of worship, or mashriq al-adhkār (Arabic:
      “a place where the uttering of the name of God arises at dawn”), in New
      Delhi. In the early 21st century it was one of only nine mashriqs in the
      world. The Lotus Temple was consecrated and opened to the public in
      December 1986. It was designed by Iranian architect Fariborz Sahba, who
      won acclaim for the project even before the temple was completed. It
      subsequently received several awards.

      The Lotus Temple derives its name from its design. Like every other Bahāī
      mashriq, it is characterized by a nine-sided construction, in keeping with
      the Bahāī belief in the mystical properties of the number nine. Set on an
      elevated plinth in a 26-acre (10.5-hectare) expanse of landscaped gardens
      and surrounded by nine pools bordered by red sandstone walkways, the white
      marble edifice rises to a height of more than 130 feet (40 metres). The
      temple complex comprises 27 independent marble “petals,” which are
      clustered into groups of three to form nine sides (through which open nine
      entrances into a central space) and into groups of nine to form three
      concentric rings. Petals in the first ring face outward, forming canopies
      over the nine entrances. The second ring covers the outer hall. In the
      innermost ring, the petals curve inward to partially enclose the central
      prayer hall, which accommodates about 2,500 people. The top of the
      structure appears open but actually contains a glass-and-steel roof that
      admits natural daylight. The overall effect is that of a floating lotus
      flower on the verge of blooming and surrounded by its leaves.
